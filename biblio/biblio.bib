abstract  ="In a previous review of biological and bioinspired silica formation (S. V. Patwardhan et al.{,} Chem. Commun.{,} 2005{,} 1113 [ref. 1]){,} we have identified and discussed the roles that organic molecules (additives) play in silica formation in vitro. Tremendous progress has been made in this field since and this review attempts to capture{,} with selected examples from the literature{,} the key advances in synthesising and controlling properties of silica-based materials using bioinspired approaches{,} i.e. conditions of near-neutral pH{,} all aqueous environments and room temperature. One important reason to investigate biosilicifying systems is to be able to develop novel materials and/or technologies suitable for a wide range of applications. Therefore{,} this review will also focus on applications arising from research on biological and bioinspired silica. A range of applications such as in the areas of sensors{,} coatings{,} hybrid materials{,} catalysis and biocatalysis and drug delivery have started appearing. Furthermore{,} scale-up of this technology suitable for large-scale manufacturing has proven the potential of biologically inspired synthesis."}

abstract  ="By the combination of prior knowledge{,} observation skills{,} and novel synthetic approaches{,} we discovered a family of mesoporous molecular sieves including discrete structures - MCM-41 (hexagonal){,} MCM-48 (cubic){,} and MCM-50 (lamellar). These materials were formed unlike that of our classical microporous structures involving reagent induced-macromolecular templating mechanism. Based on synthetic data and working with others{,} we were able to establish a predictive mechanism of formation and identify a broad class of templating reagents. These initial findings generated great interest and effort worldwide. It resulted in tremendous expansion of knowledge and skills with many new additional discoveries that established a new area of ordered mesoporous materials. They are integrated with zeolites (microporous materials) and based on surfactant inorganic chemistry."}

abstract ={Motivation: Molecular simulation has historically been a low-throughput technique, but faster computers and increasing amounts of genomic and structural data are changing this by enabling large-scale automated simulation of, for instance, many conformers or mutants of biomolecules with or without a range of ligands. At the same time, advances in performance and scaling now make it possible to model complex biomolecular interaction and function in a manner directly testable by experiment. These applications share a need for fast and efficient software that can be deployed on massive scale in clusters, web servers, distributed computing or cloud resources.Results: Here, we present a range of new simulation algorithms and features developed during the past 4 years, leading up to the GROMACS 4.5 software package. The software now automatically handles wide classes of biomolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, and comes with all commonly used force fields for these molecules built-in. GROMACS supports several implicit solvent models, as well as new free-energy algorithms, and the software now uses multithreading for efficient parallelization even on low-end systems, including windows-based workstations. Together with hand-tuned assembly kernels and state-of-the-art parallelization, this provides extremely high performance and cost efficiency for high-throughput as well as massively parallel simulations.Availability: GROMACS is an open source and free software available from http://www.gromacs.org.Contact: erik.lindahl@scilifelab.seSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract ={Macroscopic orientational ordering of the pores of condensed hexagonal mesostructured silica (MCM-41) was achieved through alignment of an unpolymerized, hexagonal, lyotropic silicate-surfactant liquid crystal in a high magnetic field. This alignment was preserved after polymerization of the silicate species by acid treatment. Subsequent calcination to remove the surfactant yielded a mesoporous silica solid that retained both macroscopic pore alignment and mesoscale periodicity. Potential applications of such liquid crystal processing strategies range from the formation of anisotropic silica-based bulk ceramics to the production of oriented mesoporous thin films for chemical sensors, separations, catalysis, or host-guest applications. },
